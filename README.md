# Text_Anonymizer
Text Anonymizer API â€” A Flask-based REST API that detects and encrypts sensitive information such as names, emails, and phone numbers in text using Microsoft's Presidio, with session-based deanonymization and OpenTelemetry tracing integration for observability.

This API provides endpoints to anonymize and deanonymize personal information (names, emails, phone numbers) in unstructured text using encryption and session-based storage. It is built with Flask, Microsoft Presidio libraries, and OpenTelemetry tracing.
